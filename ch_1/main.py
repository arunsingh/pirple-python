What's your favorite song?

Think of all the attributes that you could use to describe that song. 
That is: all of it's details or "meta-data". These are attributes like "Artist", "Year Released", "Genre", "Duration", etc. Think of as many 
different characteristics as you can.

In your text editor, create an empty file and name it main.py

Now, within that file, list all of the attributes of the song, one after another, by creating variables for each attribute, 
and giving each variable a value. Here's an example:


'''


title  = "Kaho Na Pyaar hai"
artist = "Lucky Ali, Ramya"
genre = "romantic"
lyrics = "gulzar"
Durationinseconds = "302seconds"
language = "hindi"
popularity = "***"  # 3 star rating and review out of 5 total stars
Released = "2000"  # number will be considered as string since its between the double quotes.
distributionRights = "Venus Worldwide Entertainment Pvt Ltd"



print(title)
print(artist)
print(genre)
print(lyrics)
print(Durationinseconds)
print(language)
print(popularity)
print(Released)
print(distributionRights)
